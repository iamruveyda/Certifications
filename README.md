## [Certificates, Certifications and Licenses](https://github.com/iamruveyda/Certifications/tree/main/01-Cert)

The **certificate** is evidence of education. Typically granted by programs or institutions such as universities as a result of education focused on one topic.

A **certification** is a proof that it has passed an assessment process that demonstrates mastery of a defensible set of standards or can meet industry standards.

**Licenses** are similar to certifications in that it needs to renew with continuing education. The big difference between licenses and certifications is that it may be necessary to obtain a license to be able to practice a particular profession.

> **Note**
> Certificates (completion, course, achievement, etc.), certifications and licenses issued by the institution to the person are added to the folder in the repository by the person.
